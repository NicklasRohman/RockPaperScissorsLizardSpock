Its a Rock,Paper,Scissors,Lizard and Spock game. Player writes his/her name and it will look in the database if the name already exist, if it do exist it will load player record, if not create a new player.

Playing the game:
Player press Rock,Paper,Scissors,Lizard or Spock button. The Ai will make a small calculating and try to counter the players move. 
Depending on what the player has chosen for AI level , it makes some different calculations.

The it will show how is the winner that round.

Help button will only show what takes what.
when exiting game the game will first save players record.

working progress:
I started making GUI first and all the popup windows and after that i made some button functions that was connected to the database.
Then i started to make player Class and i wanted a factory method here and it worked fine at first but the deeper i got in to the code the harder
When the game start running and i had something to show. I started to evolve it whit more AI.
I made a class diagram when i had a complete runnable game.



Ska göras:
ändra i klassdiagram att random blivit interface


finslipa css i resultBox.


(1)berorende på vad spelaren har valt för svårighetsgrad på AI gör den lite olika beräkningar.
